# gopherlyzer

## Beta Release

It's the first beta implementation of our analysis described in [Static Trace-Based Deadlock Analysis for
Synchronous Mini-Go](http://www.home.hs-karlsruhe.de/~suma0002/publications/TraceBasedDeadlockAnalysisMiniGo.pdf).

The current prototype only covers a subset of the Go language. See our examples.
We plan to add support for full recursion, anonymous functions, labels, close for channels etc. in the near future.

## Description

We consider the problem of static deadlock detection for
programs in the Go programming language which make use of synchronous
channel communications. In our analysis, regular expressions extended
with a fork operator capture the communication behavior of a program.
Starting from a simple criterion that characterizes traces of deadlock-free
programs, we develop automata-based methods to check for deadlock-
freedom. The approach is implemented and evaluated with a series of
examples.

## How to use

Configure the Go environment:

export GOROOT=/usr/local/go

export GOPATH=`*path_to_workspace*`/bin

export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin:$PATH

Install Go Oracle:

go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/oracle

Running gopherlyzer:

go run main.go -p benchmarks/philo/main.go
