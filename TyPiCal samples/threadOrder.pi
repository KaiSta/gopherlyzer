/*** TyPiCal: unsafe

Unlike Ng/Yoshida, the approach by KN properly takes care of
the order among threads.

Like some of the other examples we have seen,
the debug information provided (by KN)
can be improved.

For example, KN reports

new x in
new y in 
  x!!42. (x?v | y!!3 | y??vv)

which seems a bit confusing.

new x in
new y in 
  x!42. (x?v | y!3 | y?vv)
